              <p>
                Greetings! I am Pritam Raj, a passionate and dedicated
                Full-stack Developer. I bring a curious mindset and a creative
                approach to every project I undertake. My primary focus is on
                backend development, and I thrive on building scalable and
                efficient systems using technologies like Node.js, Express.js,
                and JavaScript.
                <br /> <br />
                In my current role as a Software Engineer (Backend Developer) at
                Mobcoder since February 2022, I have played a key role in
                developing and maintaining robust backend systems. My
                responsibilities include designing and implementing RESTful
                APIs, integrating third-party services, and ensuring seamless
                communication between frontend and backend components. Notably,
                I&lsquo;ve contributed to projects like SYN, an NFT marketplace,
                where I facilitated secure transactions and developed an
                intuitive interface for users.
                <br /> <br />
                My skill set includes a range of technologies such as Node.js,
                Express.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, MongoDB, SQL, AWS, S3,
                Redis, HTML, CSS, React.js, Python, and more. I am well-versed
                in Agile methodology, and my knowledge extends to
                object-oriented programming (OOP) and data structures and
                algorithms (DSA). I am proficient in using version control
                systems like Git and have experience deploying applications on
                EC2 instances.
                <br /> <br />
                Currently, I&lsquo;m working on the Dobrh platform, a
                freelancing platform that I am developing from scratch. This
                involves implementing authentication, wallet management, and
                review systems. I have utilized my expertise in Node.js,
                MongoDB, Redis for caching, and integrated technologies like AWS
                and S3 for optimal performance.
                <br /> <br />
                I hold a B.Tech degree from PCE Jaipur (RTU, Kota) with an
                impressive CGPA of 8. Additionally, I completed a Diploma from
                AITS, Udaipur, and my schooling at JHS, Maheshkhunt.
                <br /> <br />
                Beyond technical expertise, I bring strong personal skills to
                the table. I am a leader with effective communication skills,
                adept at time management, and thrive in collaborative team
                environments. My adaptability and problem-solving skills make me
                a valuable asset in dynamic and challenging projects.
                <br /> <br />
                I have earned certifications in Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals,
                MongoDB, Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals, Amazon EC2, and
                various HackerRank certifications showcasing expertise in Rest
                API, JavaScript, and problem-solving. I have also received a
                Python Certification from Great Learning.
                <br /> <br />
                Feel free to explore my portfolio to see firsthand examples of
                my work and the innovative solutions I&lsquo;ve brought to
                various projects. Let&lsquo;s connect and discuss how I can
                contribute to your next exciting project!
